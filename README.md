# AllePoints

A dashboard application for tracking Alle members with available points.

## Project Overview

This application connects to the Alle site, retrieves data about members including phone numbers and available points, and displays members with points in a dashboard interface.

## Development Approach

1. **Observation Session**: Schedule time to watch Kara perform her current process
2. **System Documentation**: Document the APIs and data structures for each system
3. **Prototype Development**: Create a simple Python script that demonstrates pulling data from one system
4. **Incremental Integration**: Add each system one at a time, testing thoroughly
